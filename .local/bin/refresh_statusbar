# kill the sleep command in statusbar subprocess
# to refresh instantaneously

# Inspired from Luke Smith solution 

kill $(pstree -lp | grep statusbar | sed "s/.*sleep//" | tr -d '\(,\)')

# this can also be achieved by sending a kill SIGRTMIN signal from here
# and catching the signal using the 'trap' command in statusbar refresh desired state
# as done in bugswriter dotfiles
